# 1. Introduction <a name="#p1"></a>

This paper is an attempt to summarize the results of various people's
examinations of the graphics chip "6567/6569 Video Interface Controller
(VIC-II)" (simply called "VIC" in the following) used in the legendary
Commodore 64, and to provide a complete reference to its specified and
unspecified properties. It is primarily intended for C64 programmers and
authors of C64 emulators, but should also be interesting to "outsiders"
interested in hardware design and programming and hacking a computer up to
the last bits. For this purpose, some general information (e.g. the C64
memory map) already known to experienced C64 programmers has been included
as well.

The description of the unspecified properties is based on tests done by
Marko Mäkelä, Andreas Boose, Pasi Ojala, Wolfgang Lorenz and myself (not to
mention numerous others) during the last years. It also covers internal
registers and workings of the VIC. As no schematics of the VIC are
available it can of course only be speculative, but in all cases a model
has been chosen that explains the observed phenomena with the minimally
required circuitry. E.g. for the video matrix counter (VC), a model with
two simple counters was given preference to a more elaborate one with a +40
adder.

Although some measurements have been done with an oscilloscope directly on
the chip, most insights are based on test programs on the C64 and by
comparing them with the implementation in single cycle emulations like
"Frodo SC".


# 2. The architecture of the Commodore 64 <a name="p2"></a>

This chapter gives an overview of the basic hardware architecture of the
C64 and the integration of the VIC into the system.

# 2.1. Overview <a name="p2_1"></a>

The C64 basically consists of the following units:

- 6510 8 bit microprocessor
- 6567/6569 VIC-II graphics chip
- 6581 SID sound chip
- Two 6526 CIA I/O chips
- 64KB DRAM (64K*8 bit) main memory
- 0.5KB SRAM (1K*4 bit) Color RAM
- 16KB ROM (16K*8 bit) for operating system and BASIC interpreter
- 4KB ROM (4K*8 bit) character generator

Most chips are manufactured in NMOS technology.

# 2.2. 6510 processor <a name="p2_2"></a>

The 6510 microprocessor [1] has an 8 bit data bus and a 16 bit address bus
and is object code compatible with the famous 6502. It has two external
interrupt inputs (one maskable (IRQ) and one non-maskable (NMI)) and as a
special feature a 6 bit wide bidirectional I/O port. It is clocked at 1MHz
in the C64.

Important signals:

<details style="margin-left: 5%;">
	<summary>ø2</summary>
	<p style="margin-left: 5%;">
		Processor clock output.
       This clock signal is the reference for the complete bus timing. Its
       frequency is 1022.7 kHz (NTSC models) or 985.248 kHz (PAL models).
       One period of this signal corresponds to one clock cycle consisting
       of two phases: ø2 is low in the first phase and high in the second
       phase (hence the name 'ø2' for "phase 2"). The 6510 only accesses
       the bus in the second clock phase, the VIC normally only in the
       first phase.
	</p>
</details>

<details style="margin-left: 5%;"><summary>R/W</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;">    This signal flags a read (R/W high) or write (R/W low) access.</p>
</details>

<details style="margin-left: 5%;"><summary>IRQ</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;">    If this input is held on low level, an interrupt sequence is
       triggered unless interrupts are masked with the interrupt mask bit
       in the status register. The interrupt sequence begins after two
       or more clock cycles at the start of the next instruction. With this
       pin, the VIC can trigger an interrupt in the processor. Interrupts
       are only recognized if the RDY line is high.</p>
</details>

<details style="margin-left: 5%;"><summary>RDY</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;">    If this line is low during a read access, the processor stops with
       the address lines reflecting the current address being fetched. It
       is ignored during write accesses. In the C64, RDY is used to stop
       the processor if the VIC needs additional bus cycles for character
       pointer and sprite data accesses. It is connected to the BA signal
       on the VIC.</p>
</details>

<details style="margin-left: 5%;"><summary>AEC</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;">    This pin tri-states the address lines. This is used for making the
       processor address bus inactive during VIC accesses. The signal is
       connected to the AEC output on the VIC.</p>
</details>

<details style="margin-left: 5%;"><summary>P0-P5</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;">  This is the built-in 6 bit I/O port. Each line can be individually
       programmed as input or output. A data direction register and a data
       register are internally mapped to addresses 0 and 1, respectively.
       You may therefore expect that the processor cannot access the RAM
       addresses 0 and 1 (as they are overlayed by the I/O port), but more
       on this later...</p>
