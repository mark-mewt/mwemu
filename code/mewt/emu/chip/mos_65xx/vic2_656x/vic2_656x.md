# 1. Introduction <a name="p1"></a>

This paper is an attempt to summarize the results of various people's
examinations of the graphics chip "6567/6569 Video Interface Controller
(VIC-II)" (simply called "VIC" in the following) used in the legendary
Commodore 64, and to provide a complete reference to its specified and
unspecified properties. It is primarily intended for C64 programmers and
authors of C64 emulators, but should also be interesting to "outsiders"
interested in hardware design and programming and hacking a computer up to
the last bits. For this purpose, some general information (e.g. the C64
memory map) already known to experienced C64 programmers has been included
as well.

The description of the unspecified properties is based on tests done by
Marko Mäkelä, Andreas Boose, Pasi Ojala, Wolfgang Lorenz and myself (not to
mention numerous others) during the last years. It also covers internal
registers and workings of the VIC. As no schematics of the VIC are
available it can of course only be speculative, but in all cases a model
has been chosen that explains the observed phenomena with the minimally
required circuitry. E.g. for the video matrix counter (VC), a model with
two simple counters was given preference to a more elaborate one with a +40
adder.

Although some measurements have been done with an oscilloscope directly on
the chip, most insights are based on test programs on the C64 and by
comparing them with the implementation in single cycle emulations like
"Frodo SC".


# 2. The architecture of the Commodore 64 <a name="p2"></a>

This chapter gives an overview of the basic hardware architecture of the
C64 and the integration of the VIC into the system.

## 2.1. Overview <a name="p2_1"></a>

The C64 basically consists of the following units:

- 6510 8 bit microprocessor
- 6567/6569 VIC-II graphics chip
- 6581 SID sound chip
- Two 6526 CIA I/O chips
- 64KB DRAM (64K*8 bit) main memory
- 0.5KB SRAM (1K*4 bit) Color RAM
- 16KB ROM (16K*8 bit) for operating system and BASIC interpreter
- 4KB ROM (4K*8 bit) character generator

Most chips are manufactured in NMOS technology.

## 2.2. 6510 processor <a name="p2_2"></a>

The 6510 microprocessor [1] has an 8 bit data bus and a 16 bit address bus
and is object code compatible with the famous 6502. It has two external
interrupt inputs (one maskable (IRQ) and one non-maskable (NMI)) and as a
special feature a 6 bit wide bidirectional I/O port. It is clocked at 1MHz
in the C64.

**Important signals:**

- ø2
	> Processor clock output.
	This clock signal is the reference for the complete bus timing. Its
	frequency is 1022.7 kHz (NTSC models) or 985.248 kHz (PAL models).
	One period of this signal corresponds to one clock cycle consisting
	of two phases: ø2 is low in the first phase and high in the second
	phase (hence the name 'ø2' for "phase 2"). The 6510 only accesses
	the bus in the second clock phase, the VIC normally only in the
	first phase.


- R/W
	> This signal flags a read (R/W high) or write (R/W low) access.


- IRQ
	> If this input is held on low level, an interrupt sequence is
	triggered unless interrupts are masked with the interrupt mask bit
	in the status register. The interrupt sequence begins after two
	or more clock cycles at the start of the next instruction. With this
	pin, the VIC can trigger an interrupt in the processor. Interrupts
	are only recognized if the RDY line is high.

- RDY
	> If this line is low during a read access, the processor stops with
	the address lines reflecting the current address being fetched. It
	is ignored during write accesses. In the C64, RDY is used to stop
	the processor if the VIC needs additional bus cycles for character
	pointer and sprite data accesses. It is connected to the BA signal
	on the VIC.

- AEC
	> This pin tri-states the address lines. This is used for making the
	processor address bus inactive during VIC accesses. The signal is
	connected to the AEC output on the VIC.

- P0-P5
	> This is the built-in 6 bit I/O port. Each line can be individually
	programmed as input or output. A data direction register and a data
	register are internally mapped to addresses 0 and 1, respectively.
	You may therefore expect that the processor cannot access the RAM
	addresses 0 and 1 (as they are overlayed by the I/O port), but more
	on this later...



## 2.3. 6567/6569 graphics chip <a name="p2_3"></a>

The 656* series graphics chip by MOS Technologies were originally designed
to be used in video games and graphics terminals. But as the sales in these
markets have been rather poor, Commodore decided to use the chips when they
were planning to make their own home computers.

In the C64, the "Video Interface Controller II (VIC-II)" [2] has been used,
featuring 3 text based (40x25 characters with 8x8 pixels each) and 2 bitmap
based (320x200 pixels) video modes, 8 hardware sprites and a fixed palette
of 16 colors. It can manage up to 16KB of dynamic RAM (including the
generation of RAS and CAS and the RAM refresh) and also has a light pen
input and interrupt possibilities.

Two VIC types appear in the C64: The 6567 in NTSC machines and the 6569 in
PAL machines. There are several mask steppings of both types, but the
differences are mostly neglectable with the exception of the 6567R56A.
Newer C64 versions are bearing the functionally equivalent chips 8562
(NTSC) and 8565 (PAL). In the following, only 6567/6569 will be mentioned,
but all statements are applicable for the 856* chips. There is also a 6566
designed to be connected to static RAM but this one was never used in C64s.

**Important signals:**

- A0-A13
    > The 14 bit video address bus used by the VIC to address 16KB of
	memory. The address bits A0-A5 and A8-A13 are multiplexed in pairs
	(i.e. A	, A1/A9 etc.) on one pin each. The bits A6-A11 are
	(additi	ly) available on separate lines.

- D0-D11
	> A 12 bit wide data bus over which the VIC accesses the memory. The
	lower 8 bits are connected to the main memory and the processor
	data bus, the upper 4 bits are connected to a special 4 bit wide
	static memory (1024 addresses, A0-A9) used for storing color
	information, the Color RAM.

- IRQ
	> This output is wired to the IRQ input on the processor and makes it
	possible for the VIC to trigger interrupts. The VIC has four
	interrupt sources: On reaching a certain raster line (raster
	interrupt), on the collision of two or more sprites, on the
	collision of sprites with graphics data and on a negative edge on
	the light pen input.

- BA
	> With this signal, the VIC indicated that the bus is available to
	the processor during the second clock phase (ø2 high). BA is
	normally high as the VIC accesses the bus mostly during the first
	phase. But for the character pointer and sprite data accesses, the
	VIC also needs the bus sometimes during the second phase. In this
	case, BA goes low three cycles before the VIC access. After that,
	AEC remains low during the second phase and the VIC performs the
	accesses. Why three cycles? BA is connected to the RDY line of the
	processor as mentioned, but this line is ignored on write accesses
	(the CPU can only be interrupted on reads), and the 6510 never does
	more than three writes in sequence (see [5]).

- AEC
	> This pin is wired to the processor signal with the same name (see
	there). It reflects the state of the data and address line drivers
	of the VIC. If AEC is high, they are in tri-state. AEC is normally
	low during the first clock phase (ø2 low) and high during the
	second phase so that the VIC can access the bus during the first
	phase and the 6510 during the second phase. If the VIC also needs
	the bus in the second phase, AEC remains low.

- LP
	> This input is intended for connecting a light pen. On a negative
	edge, the current position of the raster beam is latched to the
	registers LPX and LPY. As this pin shares a line with the keyboard
	matrix, it can also be accessed by software.

- øIN
	> This is the feed for the pixel clock of 8.18 MHz (NTSC) or 7.88 MHz
	(PAL) that is generated from the crystal frequency. Eight pixels
	are displayed per bus clock cycle (ø2).

- ø0
	> From the pixel clock on øIN, the VIC generates the system clock of
	1.023 MHz (NTSC) or 0.985 MHz (PAL) by dividing øIN by eight. It is
	available on this pin and fed into the processor which in turn
	generated the signal ø2 from it.

## 2.4. Memory <a name="p2_4"></a>

Three memory areas in the C64 are involved with the graphics:

- The 64KB main memory
- The 1K*4 bit Color RAM
- The 4KB character generator ROM (Char ROM)

In the following two sections it is explained how these memory areas share
the address space as seen by the CPU and the VIC. After that, the basics of
memory access and DRAM handling are mentioned.
